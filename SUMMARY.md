## Preface

* [ðŸ”­ Computational Modelling for Cognitive and Decision Sciences](README.md)

Someday this book will be complete and clear. For now, its only aim is to explain what is the advantage of doing computational modelling, how can we successfully create a computational model of a phenomenon and (if I have/take some time) introduce different examples.

Since this book started from a course in Cognitive and Decision Sciences MSc at UCL (see [website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/cognitive-and-decision-sciences-msc)), this book follows the course's structure while still departing from it. The aim is not to repeat what was presented in this course but to clarify the course's assumptions and grasp the big picture of its content.
