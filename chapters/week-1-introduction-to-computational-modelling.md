# Week 1: Introduction to Computational Modelling

## What is computational modelling?

Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) in his *Meditations* raises the superiority of the mind (*res cogitans*) over the matter (*res extensa*). The reason is that matter does not tell the *true nature* of an object because it can too easily change its form under external influences. A good example is the wax. Wax under the influence of heat can change its shape and its color. In contrast, the mind is supposed to unveil the *true nature* of objects through its activity, which is thinking. 

Many philosophers and scientists align with that perspective. The most prominent scientist is surely Galileo Galilei who started describing the physical world through mathematical formula. Beyond maths, he also entertained some thought experiments in which, without any experiment, he used sheer logic to understand the physical world. For instance, do you think that an object that is heavier falls faster than a lighter object? Many thinkers used to think that (e.g., Aristotle). Now, suppose an object that is heavier falls faster than a lighter one. If you knot a rope around a light stone (1kg) and a heavy stone (10kg), what would happen? The heavier stone should go down faster than the lighter one. At some point the rope will stretch to its maximum and the light stone should act as a parachute for the heavier stone. So the heavy stone should slow its fall because of the light stone. Yet, the combination of the two stones is heavier than the heavy stone itself (11kg + $\epsilon$). So the whole should fall faster than if the heavy stone was alone. Consequently, the heavy stone falls slower and faster than when it is alone. That is absurd. So, no, an object that is heavier doesn't fall faster than a ligher one.
